The training data here is not necessarily for training statistical but for tests as well whilst the prototypes are being built.


Files do not have headers, but are names in the format of : `protocol_date_message`, e.g. `v1_20170204_test_data`. Use dates of YYYYMMDD to cause incrementals. Versions of v1 v2 etc mean 0.1 (when 1.0 is needed, we'll push all these to a subfolder.)
